Outline:

1. Motivation
   - Practice felt inconsistent and boring; I wanted a tool Iâ€™d actually use every day.
2. Constraints
   - Solo dev, limited time, mobile-first. Focused on tiny loops and fast feedback.
3. What I built
   - Interactive drills, progress tracking, and a friendly UI.
4. What I learned
   - Ship small, listen to usage, keep the experience honest and fun.
