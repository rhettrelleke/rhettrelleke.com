This is a simple post written in Obsidian-style Markdown. You donâ€™t need to use any JSX.

If you want a styled callout later, you could do:

<Callout type="info">MDX lets you opt-in to components when you need them.</Callout>

Otherwise, keep writing Markdown as usual: lists, code, tables, etc.

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`
}
```
