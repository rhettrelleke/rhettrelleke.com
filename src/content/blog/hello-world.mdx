title: Hello, MDX

summary: First post using plain Markdown (with the option to use components).

This is a simple post written in Obsidian-style Markdown. You donâ€™t need to use any JSX.

If you want a styled callout later, you could do:

<Callout type="info">MDX lets you opt-in to components when you need them.</Callout>

Embed examples:

<YouTube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Demo" />

<SpotifyTrack id="3AhXZa8sUQht0UEdBJgpGc" />

Otherwise, keep writing Markdown as usual: lists, code, tables, etc.

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`
}
```
